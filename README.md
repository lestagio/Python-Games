# Python Games
In this repo, I am hosting multiple small games written in Python. Below is a list of each one and a little information:

Rock Paper Scissors (rps.py) - Simple rock paper scissors with ascii art and scoreboard, as well as 2 modes.

ASCII art for hand gestures was taken from wynand1004, at the following link: https://gist.github.com/wynand1004/b5c521ea8392e9c6bfe101b025c39abe
