# rock-paper-scissors-py
A small game of rock paper scissors built in python.
I made this just for fun, since I am pretty new to coding in general. 
"rpswithscore.py" is the most updated version. It plays rock paper scissors with a scoreboard.
It also has different game modes, and I fixed a few bugs I found.
