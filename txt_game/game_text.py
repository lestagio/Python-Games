                 "something else decides to attack you. You might not wake up. You remember what the rest of the crew look like,\n"

                            "You better act quick! However, you stop. You can see the whole island beneath you from this beautiful view. If you weren't about to die, maybe you would savor the view. \n"
                            "In the center of the area, there is a pedestal with a fresnel lens. You place down your kerosene lamp and light it. The creature... \n"
